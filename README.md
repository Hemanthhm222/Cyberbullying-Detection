# Cyberbullying-Detection

* With rise of social media coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic, cyberbullying has reached all time highs. We can combat this by creating models to automatically flag potentially harmful tweets as well as break down the patterns of hatred
* To classify the harmfull tweets we create a classification model based on naive bayes algorithm and Random Forest algorithm
* The code consists of 3 files for Data cleaning  :
1. Data_Preprocessing.py
2. Raw_data_modification.py
3. feature_engineering.py
